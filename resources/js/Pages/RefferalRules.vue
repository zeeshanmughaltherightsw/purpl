                                <p>For the Level 1 Referral, you will get the 5% of the total investment only once, but for Level 2 and  above, you will get the decided percentage of the total investment every month by dividing it by 30 days. For Example, if Level 3 has invested 1000$, you will get 10$ every month and 0.33 percents every day.

                                <p>From Level 2 to 15, if you want to get the commission, you must have a direct referral Level. For Example, if you want to get the commission of Level 3 investors, you must have 3 direct Referrals</p>
